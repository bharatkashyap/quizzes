			In 2005, a man called Doug Heckman, while installing utility software for his PC, noticed something in the end user license agreement that 3000 users before him had failed to notice. He called the software company up, enquired about what he had seen, and ended up getting $1,000 richer. <span style = "font-weight: 400">What did he find?</span>
