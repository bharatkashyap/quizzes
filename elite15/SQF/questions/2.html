			The X is a digital archive of the World Wide Web and other information on the Internet created by the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization, based in San Francisco, California. It was set up by Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat, and is maintained with content from Alexa Internet. The service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time, which the Archive calls a "three dimensional index." The name X was chosen as a reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon series, 'The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.'' In one episode, lead characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman routinely used a time machine called the X to witness, participate in, and, more often than not, alter famous events in history.
