			'Having visited CERN myself, I can tell you that X is not on the fourth floor - the CERN office numbering system doesn't work like that - the first digit usually refers to the building number  and the second two to the office number. But, strangely, there is no X, the offices start at 410 and work upwards - don't ask me why. Sorry to disappoint you all, but there is no X - in CERN - it simply doesn't exist, and certainly hasn't been preserved as 'the place where ______'. In fact, there is a display about this, including a model of the first NeXT server, but the whole 'X' thing is just a myth.'
