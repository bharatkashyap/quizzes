			<ul> 
				<li>'Bill Gates gets the credit but someone else did the work'
				<li>'for the first time in this decade something from Microsoft has shipped on time'
				<li>'for at least another year, it'll suck'
				<li>'regardless of all the problems with this one, calling Microsoft support wonâ€™t help.'
				<li>'can't stand on its own two feet without A LOT of third party support.'
