			In 1996, Larry Page and Sergey Brin started their Stanford University research project which went on to become the search engine we now know as Google. While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites. They called this new technology 'PageRank'; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site. Another small search engine, X, developed by IDD Information Services and designed by Robin Li, was already exploring a similar strategy for page ranking. The technology in X would be patented and used later when Li founded Y. <span style = "font-weight: 400">Identify X and Y.</span>
