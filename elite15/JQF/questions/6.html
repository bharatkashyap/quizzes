			The Year 2000 problem (also known as the Y2K problem, the Millennium bug, the Y2K bug, or simply Y2K) was a problem for both digital (computer-related) and non-digital documentation and data storage situations which resulted from the practice of abbreviating a four-digit year to two digits. This made year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900 and as a result caused major date-related errors in systems run by computers.  <br /><br />
