			X is a privately held American transportation network company based in San Francisco. The company&apos;s mobile-phone application facilitates peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting passengers who need a ride with drivers who have a car. As part of its initial branding campaign, users who offered their services on X would fix a pink moustache on the front of the car; this has since been replaced by a 5-inch long &lsquo;glowstache&rsquo; which goes on the dashboard. Identify X.
