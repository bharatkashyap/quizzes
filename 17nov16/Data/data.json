The land - nothing more than a few fishing villages at the time - went on to be sold to another nation, in 1958 for $3 million. <br/><br/>Recently however, this land has shot to fame due to the strategic importance that has come to be associated with it.

Since Bruges is a small city which dates back to the year 840,  its roads are narrow and paved in cobblestones and  predate cars, trucks, and buses. The medieval feel of Bruges has been a boon for De Halve Maan — nearly 100,000 tourists visit its facilities each year, taking in the frozen-in-time aspects of the city’s architecture while downing a fresh pint right from the brewery itself. But due to the increased beer production, those roads have become a problem. To get beer from the brewery, De Halve Maan needed a seemingly infinite stream of trucks to come in and out, and the local infrastructure simply didn’t allow for it.<br/><br/>In 2011 however, looking at a few engineers from the local telecom company working outside his brewery is allegedly what inspired De Halve Maan's owner to come up with a novel method of transportation - one that has only recently been inaugurated in Bruges. <br/>What?",

    { "question" : "The Toyota Hilux is a series of light SUV/pickup trucks that have been in production since 1968 till date. It has a reputation for exceptional sturdiness and reliability during sustained heavy use - or even abuse - a reputation that was put to the most brutal of tests by Jeremy Clarkson and co. during two episodes of Top Gear Series 3. The crew bought a 1990 Hilux; subsequently they crashed it into a tree, submerged it in the ocean for five hours, dropped it from about 10 feet, tried to crush it under an RV, drove it through a portable building, hit it with a wrecking ball, and set it on fire. Finally, they placed it on top of a 240-foot tower block that was then destroyed in a controlled demolition. When they dug it out of the rubble, all it took to get it running again was hammers, wrenches, and lubricant. They didn't even need spare parts. <br/><br/>Despite being the world's highest selling small truck, the Hilux has recently shot to notoriety because of a pattern that authorities around the world are only beginning to notice recently - a pattern that probably has something to do with its indestructable reputation.
