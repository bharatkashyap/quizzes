-------

To administer the quiz, open index.html. This file contains
a title slide and links to rules.html which, as the name suggests,
is a page that contains the quiz's rules. Once you are done with 
rules.html, open quiz.html to begin the quiz. 

-------

The file quiz.html contains the question grids for both rounds. 
When you are ready to begin the quiz, open quiz.html. The file 
consists of four sections - two grids and a title for each. 
As you progress from title to grid, scroll to a position that
makes the section's content is vertically centered. 

-------

To make the question text darker, open assets/style.css.
In the class .question-content, remove the line: font-weight: 300
and save your changes. 

--------

If, at any point, an image is too small for viewing, make sure 
you zoom into the image rather than opening the image in a new tab
and then enlarging it. The latter approach makes filenames visible 
on screen, and many images are given descriptive names which 
may give answers away.

--------

When you click on a question number in the grid, the question will
open in a new tab and corresponding question number is greyed out.
Do not close the page with the grid.
