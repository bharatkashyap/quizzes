A few days later at a developers conference, a sweat-soaked X repeatedly chanted 'developers' at least 14 times in front of the bemused gathering. Beyond his jovial image, this second cousin of famous comedian Gilda Radner is known to be a shrewd businessman with a flair to grab opportunities when they come.X has also called Linux 'communism' and the GNU GPL 'a cancer'.
